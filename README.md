## Turn programming into beautiful chaos

### Languages:
* ___Java___ - main language, mostly work with it
* _(java|type)script_ - when need to work with web frontend
* _groovy__ - when need to write scripts for myself

Loves OOP and FP

### Currently working on:
#### String art generator
Now working on desktop version
You can find console version written in java [here](https://github.com/GeorgiyO/string-art-generator-java) and web-frontend version written in javascript [here](https://github.com/GeorgiyO/string-art-generator/blob/master/full-web.js) (warning: its slow)

example of usage web-version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuuMNwQ9s6A

#### Functional library
[here](https://github.com/GeorgiyO/functional), for own use. Vavr doesn't give me the functionality I need (like currying)

_have now_: Functional interfaces with currying

_planning next_: Add interfaces for primitive types (int, long, double). Now thinks about naming of these functions (some like IIO_O that mean (int, int, <T>) -> <R>)

  
### Prjects in plans:
* Functional-reactive-fields library
* Reactive gui-framework for javaFX
